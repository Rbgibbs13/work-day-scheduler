# work-day-scheduler
Schedule activities each hour of your day!
Fill in an activity and click save, the schedule should remain even after you leave the page.
As the day progresses the current activity should be highlighted to keep you on track.

Outside of a couple references to W3 schools and MDN for proper syntax the code here is completely original.
